        Because in a world that often overlooks the heroes in white coats, you
        deserve to be noticed.Anatome was born from a simple yet powerful
        realization—there’s little that sets medical students and professionals
        apart outside their white coats. The recognition they deserve often
        fades once the coat comes off. We wanted to change that. Anatome bridges
        the gap between identity and style, offering a way for medical
        professionals to showcase their passion, pride, and dedication through
        creative, fashion-forward designs.
